MSM HSIC EHCI controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,hsic-host"
- regs : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Required interrupt resource entries are:
            HSIC EHCI expects "core_irq" and optionally "async_irq".
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" is "HSIC_VDDCX" and optionally - "HSIC_GDSC".

Example MSM HSIC EHCI controller device node :
	hsic@f9a15000 {
		compatible = "qcom,hsic-host";
		reg = <0xf9a15000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 136 0>;
		interrupt-names = "core_irq";
		HSIC_VDDCX-supply = <&pm8019_l12>;
		HSIC_GDSC-supply = <&gdsc_usb_hsic>;
	};
